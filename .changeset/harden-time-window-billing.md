Make time-windowed provider billing use the successful upstream fetch timestamp, persist the exact billing timestamp in pricing lines, avoid request-start fallback when authoritative timing is missing, and expire cached price cards at effective-date boundaries. Prepare DeepSeek V4 pricing rules to use upstream-send timing once official time windows become active. Show the currently active time-window rate in model provider tables and place it ahead of alternate period pricing in provider sheets.
