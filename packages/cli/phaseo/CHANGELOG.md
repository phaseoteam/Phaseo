### Patch Changes

- [#1032](https://github.com/phaseoteam/Phaseo/pull/1032) [`c8cd44c`](https://github.com/phaseoteam/Phaseo/commit/c8cd44cfcc7d6d48eb608dc19635266526a72468) Thanks [@DanielButler1](https://github.com/DanielButler1)! - Require explicit gateway consent before third-party OAuth can mint or use a user-funded delegated key, revoke previously issued low-scope keys, make the inference permission clear in the consent and client-management interfaces, and align refresh-token locking with immediate workspace revocation.

  Harden CLI OAuth token validation, local credential storage, Windows authorization URL launching, one-time OAuth client secret output, and backwards-compatible key-cache invalidation during the Phaseo environment-variable transition.

- [#972](https://github.com/phaseoteam/Phaseo/pull/972) [`75a2493`](https://github.com/phaseoteam/Phaseo/commit/75a2493decb405a29a1fa29348ce8d6da3d601de) Thanks [@DanielButler1](https://github.com/DanielButler1)! - Harden CLI OAuth sessions, key-pepper rotation, redirect handling, and abuse controls while moving the CLI to `api.phaseo.app`.

  Add filtered, workspace-scoped, redacted request log listing and per-request inspection to the Phaseo CLI.
