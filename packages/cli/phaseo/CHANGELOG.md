### Patch Changes

- [#1286](https://github.com/phaseoteam/Phaseo/pull/1286) [`7be11cd`](https://github.com/phaseoteam/Phaseo/commit/7be11cd461a2cb5243c8e5c3db376cdee879a113) Thanks [@DanielButler1](https://github.com/DanielButler1)! - Add explicit discounted data contribution with up to 100% redacted prompt/response retention, independently sampled upstream classification, private R2 storage, persistent task rollups, audited consent controls, and matching CLI and web management surfaces. The feature ships fail-closed behind an admin-only Statsig preview gate. Failed, incomplete, and empty upstream generations are not billed.

### Patch Changes

- [#1032](https://github.com/phaseoteam/Phaseo/pull/1032) [`c8cd44c`](https://github.com/phaseoteam/Phaseo/commit/c8cd44cfcc7d6d48eb608dc19635266526a72468) Thanks [@DanielButler1](https://github.com/DanielButler1)! - Require explicit gateway consent before third-party OAuth can mint or use a user-funded delegated key, revoke previously issued low-scope keys, make the inference permission clear in the consent and client-management interfaces, and align refresh-token locking with immediate workspace revocation.

  Harden CLI OAuth token validation, local credential storage, Windows authorization URL launching, one-time OAuth client secret output, and backwards-compatible key-cache invalidation during the Phaseo environment-variable transition.
