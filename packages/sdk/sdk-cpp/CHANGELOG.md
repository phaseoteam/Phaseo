## 2.0.0

### Major Changes

- [#1770](https://github.com/phaseoteam/Phaseo/pull/1770) [`123abbc`](https://github.com/phaseoteam/Phaseo/commit/123abbcfa38d010fedf8e6b8646e0d7ef6b0917d) Thanks [@DanielButler1](https://github.com/DanielButler1)! - Reconcile Venice model support and pricing with the live provider inventory. Removed Venice route constants are a breaking SDK change; current replacements and newly supported models are included.

- [#1531](https://github.com/phaseoteam/Phaseo/pull/1531) [`89d937e`](https://github.com/phaseoteam/Phaseo/commit/89d937efad68dfdb6ccd2ce8c7482be9897eddfb) Thanks [@DanielButler1](https://github.com/DanielButler1)! - Replace the gateway models response with a Phaseo-native catalogue of lifecycle, modality, token-limit, capability, availability, pricing, and provider-offer data. Update the CLI, MCP server, OpenAPI contract, and generated SDK models for the hard cutover, add bounded and validated CIMD OAuth client discovery while retaining dynamic registration, and verify the stateless MCP 2026-07-28 transport. Improve CLI guidance with scoped command-group help, actionable unknown-command errors, a `v` version alias, published-version checks, and sanitized catalogue output.

### Minor Changes

### Patch Changes

- [#1723](https://github.com/phaseoteam/Phaseo/pull/1723) [`bc4d4f3`](https://github.com/phaseoteam/Phaseo/commit/bc4d4f318efdc30c5ad4055960738347f894c908) Thanks [@DanielButler1](https://github.com/DanielButler1)! - Identify every official SDK and Agent SDK as its canonical technical request Source without setting App attribution.

- [#1610](https://github.com/phaseoteam/Phaseo/pull/1610) [`daf2493`](https://github.com/phaseoteam/Phaseo/commit/daf24935421185104c9b7c03fcad9f0dc44b5394) Thanks [@opencode-agent](https://github.com/apps/opencode-agent)! - Restore latency and generation metadata on successful moderation responses.

- [#1547](https://github.com/phaseoteam/Phaseo/pull/1547) [`7b5e0a0`](https://github.com/phaseoteam/Phaseo/commit/7b5e0a078be7447ae01e88b7e17775a7d0e0a4ea) Thanks [@DanielButler1](https://github.com/DanielButler1)! - Normalize video inputs and lifecycle handling across xAI, Alibaba Wan and HappyHorse, BytePlus Seedance, Fal, Runway Gen-4.5, Google AI Studio Veo, and Vertex Veo; deliver durable status-change webhooks; and temporarily disable video cancellation. HappyHorse family IDs now route text, first-frame, reference-image, and video-edit requests through the appropriate Alibaba Cloud async model with validated pricing and lifecycle recovery. Runway now uses its mode-specific task endpoints and mandatory API version, Google AI Studio Veo is routable with current pricing, and BytePlus accepts either supported gateway credential name.
